# Sup 9 Scalper

Sup 9 Scalper is a Forex expert advisor that utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze market trends and place trades accordingly. This code is a sample implementation of the Sup 9 Scalper strategy.

## Overview

Sup 9 Scalper is written in MQL5, a programming language for developing trading robots in the MetaTrader 5 platform. It uses the Python.mqh library to interact with Python and leverage its machine learning capabilities.

The expert advisor follows a simple workflow:

1. **Initialization**: The expert advisor initializes the Python environment and loads the InrexEA DB module. It connects to the XAUUSD market, enables the tick calculator, sets trade execution limits, and initializes the machine learning algorithms.

2. **Deinitialization**: When the expert advisor is shut down, it disconnects from the XAUUSD market and deinitializes the Python environment.

3. **Tick function**: On each tick update, the expert advisor retrieves the latest tick data for the current symbol. It then updates the tick data in the InrexEA DB, analyzes the market trends, and places trades based on the analysis.

4. **Custom functions**: The code includes custom functions that handle the initialization, module loading, function calls, and deinitialization of the InrexEA DB module.
